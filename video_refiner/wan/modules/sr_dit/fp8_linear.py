"""fp8 (e4m3) row-wise dynamic-scaled Linear for the DiT GEMMs.

WHY fp8 AND NOT A BETTER bf16 SCHEDULE
--------------------------------------
On a 5B SR-DiT block (48x72 token grid, dim 3072, ffn 14336, 30 blocks), one
denoise block measures ~46 ms, split:

    gemm  21.5 ms (47.1%)   <- ~140 TFLOPS = 95% of the bf16 roofline on sm90
    attn  15.9 ms (34.8%)   <- already the fused block-grid Triton kernel
    cast   4.4 ms ( 9.6%)   <- 44 kernels, the fp32 modulation chain
    elem   3.2 ms ( 6.9%)
    norm   0.8 ms ( 1.7%)

The GEMMs are AT the bf16 roofline, so there is no scheduling, layout or
fusion change that can speed them up. The only remaining lever is a
lower-precision datapath: sm90 does 296 TFLOPS of fp8, twice its bf16 rate.

MEASURED, at the real ffn shape (M=10368, K=3072, N=14336):

    bf16 mm          6.531 ms   139.8 TFLOPS
    fp8 rowwise      3.769 ms   242.3 TFLOPS   1.73x
    fp8 tensorwise   3.281 ms   278.3 TFLOPS   1.99x   <- NOT used, see below

Per block that is 21.5 -> 12.4 ms of GEMM (saves 9.1 ms) against 0.8 ms of
activation quantisation, so ~8.3 ms/block net = ~250 ms/forward. Confirmed on
the real block end-to-end: 46.065 -> 37.494 ms (1.23x), gemm 21.551 ->
11.977 ms, with +0.98 ms/block of quantisation -- the bias was folded into
the _scaled_mm epilogue (adding it as a separate op instead cost
+1.60 ms/block).

WHY ROW-WISE AND NOT PER-TENSOR
-------------------------------
Per-tensor scaling is another 15% faster but a single scale for the whole
activation matrix is set by the largest outlier in it, so every other row
loses mantissa bits. Row-wise (per token for the activation, per output
channel for the weight) costs one extra reduction and keeps each row's own
dynamic range -- the standard recipe, and the accuracy difference on real DiT
activations is far larger than the 15%.

fp8 is NOT numerically free: at the same GEMM, rel err is ~3.7e-2 against an
fp32 reference where bf16 is ~1.7e-3 -- about 22x worse, compounding over 30
blocks. That is a quality decision, not a correctness one, which is why this
whole path is OPT-IN (`--fp8_linear`) and why `skip_first`/
`skip_last`/`targets` exist to trade speed back for accuracy.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT DONE
-----------------------------
* q/k/v share one input (`self.q(x)`, `self.k(x)`, `self.v(x)`), so quantising
  once for all three would drop 2 of the 10 quantisers. Measured: the 10 cost
  0.98 ms/block together, so this saves 0.2 ms of a 37.5 ms block (0.5%). Not
  worth reaching into WanAttentionBlock for: keeping this a pure module swap
  means models.py is untouched and training cannot regress.
* A hand-written Triton quantiser would beat torch.compile's ~1.6 TB/s, but
  only by ~0.17 s over a 45-frame clip (1%). torch.compile(dynamic=False) is
  used instead, with `prewarm_quantizer` to keep inductor's per-shape compile
  off the inference path -- the same lesson the block-grid kernel taught.
